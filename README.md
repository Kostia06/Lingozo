## What is Lingozo?

Lingozo is a revolutionary language learning platform that brings the power of conversational AI to your language learning journey. Unlike traditional apps focused on repetitive exercises, Lingozo creates a natural, immersive environment where you practice real conversations with an intelligent AI tutor.

Whether you're learning Spanish, French, Japanese, or any other language, Lingozo adapts to your level and learning style, making every interaction meaningful and engaging.

- **Giving instant, constructive feedback** on your grammar and vocabulary
- **Creating a judgment-free space** where mistakes are learning opportunities
- **Making learning social and interactive** with modern messaging features
